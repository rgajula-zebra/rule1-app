"""Non-Rule#1 intrinsic-value methods.

Every function returns a `MethodResult` (or None if it cannot be honestly
computed) so the UI can render each side-by-side with the same layout.

Methods implemented:
  - dcf_two_stage        Two-stage DCF on Free Cash Flow (5yr high growth + terminal)
  - peter_lynch_fair     Lynch's "Fair PE = growth + dividend yield" heuristic
  - graham_number        Graham's sqrt(22.5 * EPS * BVPS) — deep-value floor
  - graham_formula       Graham's EPS * (8.5 + 2g) * 4.4 / bond_yield revised formula
  - peg_fair_value       PEG=1 anchor: fair PE = growth rate as integer
