"""Hybrid data source: SEC EDGAR for 10+ years of history + yfinance for snapshot.

The yfinance fetcher is fast but only returns ~4 years of annual statements.
EDGAR returns 15-20 years of official 10-K XBRL data. This module glues them:
history series come from EDGAR; current price / market cap / TTM P/E / dividend
yield / analyst growth come from yfinance.

Falls back to yfinance-only if EDGAR doesn't have the ticker (foreign filers,
recent IPOs before their first 10-K, etc.).
